    "    - current = following\n",
    "    - essentially, following is used to keep track of current.next and previous is used for current.previous\n",
    "    - as we update current.next = previous, we can then use following to go to the next node until we reach the end of the list\n",
    "    - previous = null is used in the case for an empty linked list, in which we can just return null\n",
    "3. return previous if it asks you to return the head of the linked list since previous will be a non-null value"
